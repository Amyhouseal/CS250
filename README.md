Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Through understanding a user's needs, user stories are created. These stories create a plan for the individual tasks needed to accomplish the user's needs through code or development.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- When developing programs, I take an agile approach to the software development life cycle by integrating continuous development. Creating user stories allows me to breakdown the program into smaller more attainable goals and allows me to focus on quality.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- To be a good team member in software is to be a team player who is committed to quality and avoidant of technological debt.
